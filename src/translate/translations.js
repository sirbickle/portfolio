    <p>Hi, I’m Leonardo Lima, I’m 25 years old, I live in Sorocaba, and I have experience as an IT Project Manager, where I have implemented SAP systems in companies such as Braskem, Claro, and Suzano. I was also an IT Support at Atacadão and I have a degree in Technology in Analysis and Systems Development.</p>
    <p>Besides work, I have many interests that help keep my mind active: I am a fan of games, from classics like Warcraft 3 and Starcraft to World of Warcraft and Counter-Strike 2. I also enjoy board games and card games, and from time to time, I play a game of chess.</p>
    <p>Music is another passion: I play bass and guitar, which helps me disconnect a bit from the digital world. For 3 years (2020-2023), I played in a band called Atrois, where we did a few shows and recorded and released, in 2022, our first EP titled Na Mão do Palhaço (In the Clown's Hands), which is available on digital platforms.</p>
    <p>When I'm not involved in IT projects, playing, or programming, I like to practise sports, especially running and working out.</p>
    <p>Finally, I'm curious and passionate about nature, travel, new cultures, and exploration.</p>
    <p>I enjoy learning about science, such as cosmology, astronomy, physics, and related topics. I'm also always looking to learn new languages to connect better with the world.</p>

    <p>My educational journey began in 2005 at Lea Edy Alonso Saliba Preschool, where I studied until 2006. In 2007, I entered the 1st grade (2nd year) at the same school and stayed there until 2010, when I completed the 4th grade (5th year).</p>
    <p>In 2011, I started at a new school, Isabel Lopes Monteiro, where I stayed until 2014, preparing for secondary school. During this time, I joined the handball team, and we became vice-champions in the JES competition against Matheus Maylasky School. I also joined the basketball team in the following years. Although we didn’t achieve significant results, it was a fun and enriching experience.</p>
    <p>During primary school, my interest in languages began to grow, which led me to explore options at CEL (Centre of Languages). There were several languages on offer, such as French, Italian, English, Japanese, and German. German caught my attention, both because of its pronunciation and because I wasn’t very familiar with the culture, so I decided to seize the opportunity.</p>
    <p>Although I am currently focused on studying Russian, I still hold a great fondness for German. It was this experience that opened the doors to my interest in new cultures and languages.</p>
    <p>Throughout the course, I had incredible moments, such as conversing with native speakers and even applying for the chance to travel to Germany through the Goethe-Institut. Unfortunately, the selection was done by lottery, and I wasn’t chosen.</p>
    <p>After finishing my studies at Isabel Lopes Monteiro, I went on to study at Senador Luiz Nogueira Martins from 2015 to 2017, where I completed my secondary education.</p>
    <p>In 2022, I enrolled at Sorocaba Engineering College (FACENS) to pursue a Higher National Diploma in Systems Analysis and Development, graduating in 2024.</p>

    <p>Without a doubt, Judo holds great significance in my life. I began practising at the age of 7 or 8 and stopped when I was around 14 or 15. Throughout my journey, I had the honour of participating in the Paulista Judo Federation, travelling to various towns and cities cross the state of São Paulo for competitions. I trained at the Bandeirantes Sorocaba gym and was a student of Sensei Antonio Rizzardo.</p>
    <p>I have a considerable background in Judo, having participated in competitions since 2007, both in Sorocaba and in other cities through the Paulista Judo Federation. In total, I won 28 championships between 2007 and 2013. The most memorable were the Regional, where I became the champion, and the State, where I was the runner-up.</p>
    <p>The main reason my mother enrolled me in Judo was because I was quite impulsive and needed to channel my energy in a constructive way. I tried other sports, such as swimming and football, but the only one that truly captivated me was Judo. However, due to the timing of my German course, I had to stop practising Judo and ended my activities at green belt, with just three belts remaining to achieve black belt.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, Judo was not the only sport I practised. I was the runner-up in Handball during primary school at the JES (Student Games) competition. At present, I still practise sports such as running, having participated in several marathons, in addition to going to the gym.</p>

    <p><strong>"The Earth is the cradle of humanity, but one cannot live in the cradle forever,"</strong> said Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, a pioneer of astronautics.</p>
    <p>Like every child, I too dreamt of becoming an astronaut, fuelled by films, cartoons, and video games. However, just like many others, I eventually set that dream aside to pursue a different path, graduating in the field of IT. I worked as a support technician and project manager, and during this time, I realised the impact my work had on the lives of others. Yet, I understood that I wanted to direct my contributions to something that had always fascinated me: space.</p>
    <p>The current moment in space exploration has rekindled my curiosity. The advancements in manned missions, the growing presence of private companies, and the increasing investment by countries in the sector, coupled with the real possibility of a new space age, made me realise that I wanted to be part of this. That is why I decided to transition to Aerospace Engineering.</p>
    <p>My goals are clear: I want to become an aerospace engineer and continue my studies, with a master's degree, postgraduate studies, and a PhD. I wish to work for a space agency and, at the end of my career, become a university professor to share the knowledge I have gained throughout my journey.</p>
    <p>To start understanding how this area of engineering works, I began studying independently. The AEB (Brazilian Space Agency) has made some courses available in the field of Aerospace Sciences, which I am using to learn about basic concepts, space, motion, gravity and weight, propulsion, and nanosatellites. I also participated in the IASC (International Astronomical Search Collaboration) programme, a global project that involves students and enthusiasts in the search for asteroids and other space objects using telescope images. This work contributes to scientific research and monitoring of risks to Earth.</p>

    <p>Russia has always attracted me due to its strong history in space exploration. The country was a pioneer with historic milestones such as the launch of the first satellite, Sputnik, and sending the first human into space, Yuri Gagarin. Its contributions continue with innovations in the development of rockets like the Soyuz, which are still used in space missions. Russia is a global leader in the development of aerospace technologies, with cutting-edge research infrastructure and advanced space programmes, such as the lunar exploration programme.</p>
    <p>Moreover, the country has a long tradition of academic excellence, with renowned universities that stand out in fields like engineering and natural sciences. Collaboration with international students is a historical characteristic, and this, combined with the strong rankings of Russian universities in international rankings, makes the country an ideal place for my professional development.</p>
    <p>The geographical and cultural diversity of Russia is also a major attraction. With stunning landscapes, such as the marble quarries of Karelia, the crystal-clear waters of Lake Baikal, and the volcanoes of Kamchatka, the country offers a rich natural experience. Its culture, with great literary classics by names like Pushkin, Tolstoy, and Dostoevsky, and classical music by Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff, complement the experience, making Russia a unique place to study and live.</p>
    <p>I am aware that the transition to Aerospace Engineering will be challenging, but I am determined to dedicate all my effort to achieving this goal. I have full confidence that, with the knowledge I will acquire, I will be able to contribute significantly to the advancement of technology and science in the aerospace field, as well as share my learning with future generations.</p>

    <p>Sem dúvida, o Judô tem uma grande importância na minha vida. Comecei a praticar aos 7 ou 8 anos e parei por volta dos 14 ou 15. Durante minha trajetória, tive a honra de participar da Federação Paulista de Judô, viajar para vários municípios do estado de São Paulo em competições, treinar na Academia Bandeirantes Sorocaba e ser aluno do Sensei Antonio Rizzardo.</p>
    <p>Tenho um currículo considerável no Judô, com participações em competições desde 2007, tanto em Sorocaba quanto em outras cidades pela Federação Paulista de Judô. Ao todo, conquistei 28 campeonatos entre 2007 e 2013. Os mais marcantes foram o Regional, onde fui campeão, e o Estadual, onde conquistei o título de vice-campeão.</p>
    <p>O principal motivo de minha mãe me inscrever no Judô foi o fato de eu ser muito impulsivo e precisar canalizar minha energia de forma construtiva. Tentei outros esportes, como natação e futebol, mas o único que realmente me cativou foi o Judô. Porém, devido ao horário do meu curso de alemão, precisei interromper o Judô e encerrei minhas atividades na faixa verde, com apenas 3 faixas restantes para alcançar a faixa preta.</p>
    <p>No entanto, o Judô não foi o único esporte que pratiquei. Fui vice-campeão de Handebol no Ensino Fundamental, no campeonato JES (Jogos Estudantis). Atualmente, continuo praticando esportes como corrida, já tendo participado de algumas maratonas, além de frequentar a academia.</p>

    <p><strong>"A Terra é o berço da humanidade, mas não se pode viver no berço para sempre"</strong>, disse Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, pioneiro da astronáutica.</p>
    <p>Como toda criança, eu também sonhei em ser astronauta, alimentado por filmes, desenhos e jogos de videogame. No entanto, assim como muitos, acabei deixando esse sonho de lado para seguir outro caminho, me formando na área de T.I. Trabalhei como suporte e gerente de projetos, e durante esse período, percebi o impacto que meu trabalho tinha na vida de outras pessoas. Porém, entendi que queria direcionar minhas contribuições para algo que sempre me fascinou: o espaço.</p>
    <p>O momento atual da exploração espacial reacendeu minha curiosidade. Os avanços em missões tripuladas, a crescente presença de empresas privadas e o aumento do investimento de países no setor, junto à possibilidade real de uma nova era espacial, me fizeram perceber que queria fazer parte disso. Por isso, decidi fazer a transição para a Engenharia Aeroespacial.</p>
    <p>Meus objetivos são bem claros: quero me tornar engenheiro aeroespacial e continuar meus estudos, com mestrado, pós-graduação e doutorado. Desejo trabalhar em uma agência espacial e, ao final da minha carreira, me tornar professor universitário, para compartilhar o conhecimento adquirido ao longo da minha trajetória.</p>
    <p>Para começar a entender como funciona esse lado da engenharia, comecei a estudar por conta própria. A AEB (Agência Espacial Brasileira) disponibilizou alguns cursos na área de Ciências Aeroespaciais, que estou utilizando para aprender sobre conceitos iniciais, espaço, movimento, gravidade e peso, propulsão e nanosatélites. Também participei do programa IASC (International Astronomical Search Collaboration), um projeto global que envolve estudantes e entusiastas na busca de asteroides e outros objetos espaciais, utilizando imagens de telescópios. Esse trabalho contribui para a pesquisa científica e o monitoramento de riscos à Terra.</p>

    <p>Здравствуйте, меня зовут Леонардо Лима, мне 25 лет, я живу в Сорокабе и окончил курс по анализу и разработке систем. У меня есть опыт работы менеджером проектов в области ИТ, в том числе внедрение системы SAP в такие компании, как Braskem, Claro и Suzano. Я также работал в поддержке ИТ в компании Atacadão.</p>
    <p>Кроме работы, у меня есть много увлечений, которые помогают держать мой ум в тонусе. Я фанат игр, от классики, такой как Warcraft 3 и Starcraft, до World of Warcraft и Counter-Strike 2. Мне также нравятся настольные игры и карточные игры, а время от времени я играю в шахматы.</p>
    <p>Музыка — еще одна моя страсть: я играю на бас-гитаре и гитаре, что помогает мне немного отключиться от цифрового мира. В течение 3 лет (с 2020 по 2023 год) я играл в группе под названием Atrois, с которой мы давали несколько концертов, записали и выпустили в 2022 году наш первый EP, под названием *На Руке У Клоуна* (Na Mão do Palhaço), который доступен на цифровых платформах.</p>
    <p>Когда я не занят проектами в ИТ, играми или программированием, я люблю заниматься спортом, особенно бегом и тренировками в спортзале.</p>
    <p>В конце концов, я любознателен и увлечен природой, путешествиями, новыми культурами и исследованиями.</p>
    <p>Мне нравится изучать такие науки, как космология, астрономия, физика и другие связанные с ними темы. Я также всегда стремлюсь учить новые языки, чтобы лучше понять мир.</p>

    <p>Мой образовательный путь начался в 2005 году в дошкольном учреждении Lea Edy Alonso Saliba, где я завершил учебу в 2006 году. В 2007 году я поступил в 1-й класс (2-й год обучения) в той же школе, где учился до 2010 года, когда окончил 4-й класс (5-й год обучения).</p>
    <p>В 2011 году я начал учёбу в новой школе Isabel Lopes Monteiro, где начал заключительную фазу обучения в начальной школе. Я учился там до 2014 года и участвовал в команде по гандболу, которая стала вице-чемпионами на соревнованиях JES против школы Matheus Maylasky. Хотя я также участвовал в баскетбольной команде в следующие годы, мне не удалось достичь выдающихся результатов, но я получил массу удовольствия.</p>
    <p>Во время начальной школы я начал интересоваться изучением нового языка, поэтому я изучил предложения в CEL (Центре Языков). Там предлагались различные языки: французский, итальянский, английский, японский и немецкий, и немецкий привлёк моё внимание, как своим произношением, так и тем, что я мало знал о культуре, поэтому я решил, что это будет отличная возможность.</p>
    <p>Хотя я больше не изучаю немецкий (поскольку заинтересовался русским), у меня всё ещё остаются тёплые воспоминания об этом языке. Он открыл для меня новые культуры и возможность изучать новые языки.</p>
    <p>В ходе обучения я получил потрясающий опыт, общаясь с носителями языка, а также была возможность посетить страну через программу Гёте, хотя я не смог поехать, так как это было основано на лотерее.</p>
    <p>После окончания учёбы в Isabel Lopes Monteiro я продолжил обучение в Senador Luiz Nogueira Martins с 2015 по 2017 год и закончил среднюю школу.</p>
    <p>В 2022 году я поступил в факультет инженерии города Сорокаба на программу Технолог по анализу и разработке систем и окончил обучение в 2024 году.</p>

    <p>Без сомнений, дзюдо занимает важное место в моей жизни. Я начал заниматься этим спортом в возрасте 7 или 8 лет и прекратил в возрасте 14 или 15 лет. В этом спорте мне посчастливилось участвовать в Федерации дзюдо штата Сан-Паулу, путешествовать по различным городам штата Сан-Паулу для участия в соревнованиях, тренироваться в академии Bandeirantes в Сорокабе и быть учеником сенсея Антонио Ризардо.</p>
    <p>У меня есть довольно внушительное резюме в дзюдо, в плане участия в соревнованиях, начиная с 2007 года в Сорокабе и других городах штата, с общим количеством 28 выигранных чемпионатов с 2007 по 2013 год. Однако самые яркие воспоминания оставили чемпионат регионального уровня, где я стал чемпионом, и чемпионат штата, где я стал вице-чемпионом.</p>
    <p>Основной причиной, по которой мама отдала меня в этот спорт, было то, что я был довольно импульсивным и мне нужно было найти способ потратить энергию. Я пробовал другие виды спорта, такие как плавание и футбол, но единственным, который мне по-настоящему понравился, было дзюдо. Из-за расписания курсов немецкого языка мне пришлось отказаться от дзюдо, и я завершил свою карьеру на зелёном поясе, не дойдя всего лишь до 3-х поясных ступеней для получения чёрного пояса.</p>
    <p>Однако я занимался не только дзюдо, я также стал вице-чемпионом по гандболу на школьных играх JES (Игры Студентов). В настоящее время я продолжаю заниматься спортом, бегал в нескольких марафонах и посещаю тренажерный зал.</p>

    <p><strong>«Земля — колыбель человечества, но нельзя жить в колыбели всю жизнь»</strong>, сказал Константин Циолковский, пионер астронавтики.</p>
    <p>Как и все дети, я тоже мечтал стать астронавтом, вдохновлённый фильмами, мультсериалами и видеоиграми. Однако, как и многие другие, я в конечном итоге оставил эту мечту и пошёл по другому пути, получив образование в области информационных технологий. Я работал в качестве специалиста по поддержке и менеджера проектов, и в процессе работы понял, какое влияние моя деятельность оказывает на жизни других людей. Тем не менее, я осознал, что хочу направить свои усилия на то, что всегда меня увлекало: космос.</p>
    <p>Текущий момент в области космических исследований пробудил моё любопытство. Прогресс в пилотируемых миссиях, растущее присутствие частных компаний и увеличение инвестиций стран в эту отрасль, а также реальная возможность новой космической эры, заставили меня осознать, что я хочу быть частью этого процесса. Поэтому я решил перейти в область аэрокосмической инженерии.</p>
    <p>Мои цели вполне ясны: я хочу стать инженером-аэрокосмистом и продолжить обучение, получив степень магистра, аспиранта и доктора наук. Я хочу работать в космическом агентстве и, в конце своей карьеры, стать университетским преподавателем, чтобы передавать знания, полученные на протяжении всей моей карьеры.</p>
    <p>Чтобы начать понимать, как работает эта сторона инженерии, я начал учиться самостоятельно. AEB (Бразильское космическое агентство) предложило несколько курсов в области аэрокосмических наук, которые я использую для изучения начальных понятий, пространства, движения, гравитации и веса, пропульсии и наносатэллитов. Я также участвовал в программе IASC (Международное астрономическое поисковое сотрудничество), мировом проекте, который включает студентов и энтузиастов в поисках астероидов и других космических объектов с использованием изображений телескопов. Эта работа вносит вклад в научные исследования и мониторинг рисков для Земли.</p>

    <p>Россия всегда привлекала меня своей богатой историей в области космических исследований. Страна стала пионером с такими историческими достижениями, как запуск первого спутника, Спутника, и отправка первого человека в космос, Юрия Гагарина. Её вклад продолжается с инновациями в разработке ракет, таких как Союз, которые до сих пор используются в космических миссиях. Россия является мировым лидером в области разработки аэрокосмических технологий, с передовой исследовательской инфраструктурой и развитыми космическими программами, такими как программа исследования Луны.</p>
    <p>Кроме того, страна имеет долгую традицию академического превосходства, с известными университетами, которые выделяются в таких областях, как инженерия и естественные науки. Сотрудничество с международными студентами является исторической особенностью, и это, в сочетании с высокими позициями российских университетов в международных рейтингах, делает страну идеальным местом для моего профессионального развития.</p>
    <p>Географическое и культурное разнообразие России также является важным фактором. С потрясающими пейзажами, такими как мраморные карьеры Карелии, кристально чистые воды озера Байкал и вулканы Камчатки, страна предлагает богатый природный опыт. Её культура, с великими литературными классиками, такими как Пушкин, Толстой и Достоевский, а также классической музыкой Чайковского и Рахманинова, дополняет этот опыт, превращая Россию в уникальное место для учебы и жизни.</p>
    <p>Я осознаю, что переход в аэрокосмическую инженерию будет непростым, но я решительно настроен приложить все усилия для достижения этой цели.
